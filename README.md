Contains the data and scripts to run the following analyses:

* WGCNA analysis of the OTU abundances at the four sites.
* Hierarchichal clustering of the isolates based on their KOs. These clusters are interpreted  by calculating odds ratios for each cluster-KO pair.
* Associating the WGCNA network modules (defined on the OTUs) with the isolate clusters using beta regression.
